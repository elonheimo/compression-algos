Spent a lot of time studying the algorithms and deciding the subject for the project. Tried to relearn some python. Made the git repository. Researched what dependencies to utilize in order to create compression algorithms in python.

A bit stressed about the project. I think this project is a excellent opportunity to learn a lot.

Time spent: 8 hours
